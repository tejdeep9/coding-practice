1. Handles complex constructors
2. Constructors with large number of parameters
3. Immutability ( we can force immutabliity)
Examples: String Builder, Document Builder, Local.Builder


Design:
-Creating a constructors with multiple parameter variations is difficult to manage. creating a constrcutor with multiple parameters is called telescoping constructors.
-Builder pattern will overcome this problem.
-static inner class
- calls appropriate constructor
- negates the need of exposed setters

Pitfalls:
-immutable
-static inner class
-Designed first
-Complexity
